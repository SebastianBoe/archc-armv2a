This text describes ISA differences between the Amber core, ARMv2a and ARMv5e.

# Instructions introduced in ARMv5e, ARMv5

Q{D}ADD Rd, Rm, Rn, Add, saturating {doubled}, 
Q{D}SUB Rd, Rm, Rn, Subtract, saturating {doubled}, Multiply, SMULxy
SMULWy, Multiply 
SMLAxy, Multiply 
SMLAWy, Multiply
SMLALxy, Multiply 
CLZ Rd, Rm, Count leading zeros
BLX Rm, Branch with link and exchange
STRD, Store a double 
LDRD, Load  a double
PLD, Prefetch 
MRRC, Some coprocessor operation
MCRR, Some coprocessor operation
BKPT, Breakpoint

# There is an oddity with the LDRT and STRT instructions
ARM defines them to be implemented by all architectures,
but the Amber core does not implement them. 

They seem to only be needed when you have virtual memory, which SHMAC does not support.
It should be safe to not implement them.

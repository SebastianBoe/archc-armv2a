# ARMv2a instructions that are missing in the Amber core.
##########################################################

# LDRT/STRT
There is an oddity with the LDRT and STRT instructions
ARM defines them to be implemented by all architectures,
but the Amber core does not implement them. 

They seem to only be needed when you have virtual memory, which SHMAC does not support.
It should be safe to not implement them. 

# MSR / MRS
MSR and MRS are defined by ARM to be required for all architectures, but Amber does not implement them,
so neither shall we. Even though they seem rather usefull when dealing with exceptions and whatnot.
